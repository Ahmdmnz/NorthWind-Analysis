# Project Background
Northwind Traders is a small business that imports and exports specialty foods globally. Its dataset provides a comprehensive view of operations, encompassing orders, products, customers, suppliers, shipping, employees, and basic accounting.

In this project, i focus on extracting critical insights around sales performance, customer behavior, product trends, and operational efficiency. By analyzing these aspects, we aim to deliver actionable recommendations that can guide strategic decisions and drive business growth.

Insights & Recommendations  
- **Sales Performance**  
  We focus on Total Revenue to gauge overall success, track Sales Growth Rate to spot trends over time, use Average Order Value (AOV) to refine pricing, and break    down Revenue Segmentation by product, category, and region to see what’s driving results.  

- **Customer Behavior**  
  Understanding Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** helps prioritize high-value clients, while the Repeat Purchase Rate signals loyalty. Highlighting Top Customers       guides retention efforts, and the Customer Retention Rate shows how well we keep shoppers coming back.  

- **Order Fulfillment & Shipping**  
  We measure On-Time Delivery Rate to ensure reliability, monitor Average Shipping Time to catch delays, and keep Freight Cost as % of Sales in check to balance     efficiency and expenses.  

- **Product & Inventory Management**  
  Spotlighting Top-Selling Products helps allocate resources, Product Contribution to Revenue identifies star performers, Inventory Turnover (if tracked) optimizes   stock levels, and Supplier Lead Time ensures timely restocking.  

- **Employee Performance**  
  Sales per Employee and Orders Handled per Employee reveal productivity gaps, while Employee Sales Growth highlights who’s excelling over time. 

- **Financial Health**  
  Gross Profit Margin keeps tabs on operational efficiency, and Net Profit Margin tells the full story of profitability after all costs.
