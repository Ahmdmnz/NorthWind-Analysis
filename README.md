Insights & Analytical Focus Areas

Insights & Recommendations  
- **Sales Performance Analysis**  
  We focus on Total Revenue to gauge overall success, track Sales Growth Rate to spot trends over time, use Average Order Value (AOV) to evaluate contract value 
  evolution, and break down Revenue Segmentation by time period to identify performance patterns.

- **Year-over-Year Trend Analysis**  
  Understanding Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** helps prioritize high-value clients, while the Repeat Purchase Rate signals loyalty. Highlighting Top Customers       guides retention efforts, and the Customer Retention Rate shows how well we keep shoppers coming back.  

- **Target Achievement Metrics**  
  We evaluate Revenue to Target measurements to assess how effectively the company is meeting its established goals, while tracking the progression of target 
  achievement across the 2015-2021 timeline.

- **Historical Revenue Patterns**  
  Through both cumulative and monthly revenue analysis, we highlight growth trajectories and identify critical turning points in the company's financial 
  performance.
