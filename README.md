# Project Background
Northwind Traders is a small business that imports and exports specialty foods globally. Its dataset provides a comprehensive view of operations, encompassing orders, products, customers, suppliers, shipping, employees, and basic accounting.

In this project, i focus on extracting critical insights around sales performance, customer behavior, product trends, and operational efficiency. By analyzing these aspects, we aim to deliver actionable recommendations that can guide strategic decisions and drive business growth.

Insights & Recommendations  
**Sales Performance**  
We focus on **Total Revenue** to gauge overall success, track **Sales Growth Rate** to spot trends over time, use **Average Order Value (AOV)** to refine pricing, and break down **Revenue Segmentation** by product, category, and region to see what’s driving results.  

**Customer Behavior**  
Understanding **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** helps prioritize high-value clients, while the **Repeat Purchase Rate** signals loyalty. Highlighting **Top Customers** guides retention efforts, and the **Customer Retention Rate** shows how well we keep shoppers coming back.  

**Order Fulfillment & Shipping**  
We measure **On-Time Delivery Rate** to ensure reliability, monitor **Average Shipping Time** to catch delays, and keep **Freight Cost as % of Sales** in check to balance efficiency and expenses.  

**Product & Inventory Management**  
Spotlighting **Top-Selling Products** helps allocate resources, **Product Contribution to Revenue** identifies star performers, **Inventory Turnover** (if tracked) optimizes stock levels, and **Supplier Lead Time** ensures timely restocking.  

**Employee Performance**  
**Sales per Employee** and **Orders Handled per Employee** reveal productivity gaps, while **Employee Sales Growth** highlights who’s excelling over time.  

**Financial Health**  
**Gross Profit Margin** keeps tabs on operational efficiency, and **Net Profit Margin** tells the full story of profitability after all costs.
